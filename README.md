# Bootiful - Open-source, bare, modern Bootstrap v5 theme

## Demo

A fully clickable demo is available here : [bootiful.org](https://bootiful.org)

## Usage

This project uses a simple gulp.js file. But your own project probably uses something more sophisticated, like Laravel, NextJS, or Ruby-on-Rails.

So, first : use bootstrap v5 as you normally would in your project.

Then copy/paste the HTML, (S)CSS, and JS of this project into your own build.

### SCSS

Copy the src/sass folder in your own project, then compile the SCSS with your own build.

### HTML

Either look at the HTML files under `src/*.html`, `src/partials/*.html`.

Or go to the clickable demo and copy/paste html from there : [bootiful.org](https://bootiful.org)

### JS

This project tries to use the fewest possible JS. However there are certain situation where Bootstrap is unable to initialize some components : Toast messages are meant to be initialized by users, not the framework.

In this case, the initialisation happens in the HTML files.
